"""
A lightweight wrapper around Python's sqlite3 database, with a dict-like interface
and multi-thread access support::

>>> mydict = SqliteDict('some.db', autocommit=True) # the mapping will be persisted to file `some.db`
>>> mydict['some_key'] = any_picklable_object
>>> print mydict['some_key']
>>> print len(mydict) # etc... all dict functions work

Pickle is used internally to serialize the values. Keys are strings.

If you don't use autocommit (default is no autocommit for performance), then
don't forget to call `mydict.commit()` when done with a transaction.

        Initialize a thread-safe sqlite-backed dictionary. The dictionary will
        be a table `tablename` in database file `filename`. A single file (=database)
        may contain multiple tables.

        If no `filename` is given, a random file in temp will be used (and deleted
        from temp once the dict is closed/deleted).

        If you enable `autocommit`, changes will be committed after each operation
        (more inefficient but safer). Otherwise, changes are committed on `self.commit()`,
        `self.clear()` and `self.close()`.

        Set `journal_mode` to 'OFF' if you're experiencing sqlite I/O problems
        or if you need performance and don't care about crash-consistency.

        Set `outer_stack` to False to disable the output of the outer exception
        to the error logs.  This may improve the efficiency of sqlitedict
        operation at the expense of a detailed exception trace.

        The `flag` parameter. Exactly one of:
          'c': default mode, open for read/write, creating the db/table if necessary.
          'w': open for r/w, but drop `tablename` contents first (start with empty table)
          'r': open as read-only
          'n': create a new database (erasing any existing tables, not just `tablename`!).

        The `encode` and `decode` parameters are used to customize how the values
        are serialized and deserialized.
        The `encode` parameter must be a function that takes a single Python
        object and returns a serialized representation.
        The `decode` function must be a function that takes the serialized
        representation produced by `encode` and returns a deserialized Python
        object.
        The default is to use pickle.

        The `timeout` defines the maximum time (in seconds) to wait for initial Thread startup.
